# Q-Wellness (Frontend)
This is the repo for the frontend portion of my final year
project. For the backend see: https://github.com/ChrisLoucaides/qwellness

## Pre-requisites:
- A **code editor or IDE** (not required but recommended as it makes running the project locally far easier). For the development of this project I used PyCharm (for backend, however it can also run frontend projects) and WebStorm (for frontend)
  - **Recommendations**:
  - PyCharm (There is a paid and free version, can run both backend  and frontend apps)
  -  Visual Studio Code (Free, can run both backend  and frontend apps)
  - WebStorm (Paid version only, but there is a free trial, support for only frontend apps)

- **Installation of Node.js** and python 3.10 (If you use PyCharm a version of python will already come bundled with the IDE.
  - Node.js Installation Guide
  - Python Installation

## Getting the project set up locally

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

2. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Note: This project will not work correctly without also running the backend locally
