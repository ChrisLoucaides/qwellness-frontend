# Q-Wellness (Frontend)
This is the repo for the frontend portion of my final year
project. For the backend see: https://github.com/ChrisLoucaides/qwellness



## Getting the project set up locally

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

2. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Note: This project will not work correctly without also running the backend locally
